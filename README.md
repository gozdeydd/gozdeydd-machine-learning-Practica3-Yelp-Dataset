   1. Project Title : Analisis of Yelp Dataset

This is an assignment I did for our "Machine Learning" course in our Master of Data Science in CUNEF. I am analysing a Yelp Academic Dataset. which can be found from this link.

    2. Problem Description:

I am trying to understand which restaurants are likely to receive a rating equal to 4 or over in Philedelphia. Where should a new restaurant should be located and what properties this restaurant should have.

In this project it was for me for the first time to process this much large size data in json format. I have learned how to handle. And first time trying to understand geoespatial data. I also try to understand networks nodes and edges 

    3. How to Install and Run the Project?

I have used python version 3.10. Environment details will be found and requirements file in env folder.

    4. How to use the Project?

This is a data analisis project. You can consult to our code for your own projects on different other topics. In addition, if you would like to contribute to this particular project, you can make a pull request to improve our analisis. I am beginners, we are open to all suggestions. We also would like to help all beginners like us. Please do not hesitate to contact if you want to ask anything.

My plan is to update in future with some other type of analisis. 

    5. Content of the Files:

data:
    Raw: Geodata downloded from 
    Processed data: processed pickle files


htmls: Notebooks exported as html files and other outputs of the notebooks as html.

notebooks: Notebooks of the project.

env : enviroment requirements to be downloaded.

   6. Roadmap to Follow:

Notebook 0 is optional because it is also possible to open the file in the operationsystem.
Notebook 1 is processing data, if you would like to, you can use directly from pickle file as well. Other notebooks work without this step.
